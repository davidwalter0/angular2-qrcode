*Authenticated vs Unauthenticated*

Basic config of the base app on connect unauthenticated empty page is
presented. Once authenticated the application authenticated component
is activated.


```
    git clone github.com/davidwalter0/angular2-auth-base
    cd angular2-auth-base
    ng serve 
```

*Miscellany*

- The facebook config implementation wasn't tested
- Exported firebase configuration to firebase.credentials.ts and
  renamed firebaseConfigCredentials
- Add firebase.credentials.ts.empty, rename to firebase.credentials.ts
  and update with the credentials
- Add the firebase.credentials.ts file name to gitignore to keep
  credentials out of git repo
- chmod 600 firebase.credentials.ts


```
export const firebaseConfigCredentials = {
  apiKey: '',
  authDomain: '',
  databaseURL: '',
  storageBucket: '',
  messagingSenderId: ''
};
```
